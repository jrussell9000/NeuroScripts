#!fmri_file_template    # The first part of this line MUST be present or
#                         this file won't be recognized as a template.

# Template defining the naming convention to be used by the 
# preprocess script. Edit the fields in the "Value" column to change the file structure.
# This file follows the "yaml" (yet-another-markup-language) syntax. For this format,
# indentation is very important.  That is how it differentiates between attributes and
# sub-attributes.  The only other special syntax in the file below is "---", the colon 
# after each tag-name, the brackets around lists of items separated by commas, and the 
# "&id00n" variables.  These latter variables should be numbered sequentially as below.
#
# Here are some basic syntax rules:
# 1. The code "#!fmri_file_template" must appear at the beginning of the first line of the file.
#
# 2. The code "---" is a delimiter used by yaml. Keep them where they are.
#
# 3. Indentation is important.  Always use the same indentation for a given block.  For
#                               example, the "anat" block has two items, "outdir" and
#                               "format".  The parser figures this out because both
#                               are indented 4 spaces from the left margin.
#
# 4. The colon is used instead of an equal. 
#
# 5. A space must follow the colon.
#
# 6. Brackets denote a list.  Each member of the list must be followed by a comma.
#
# 7. The &id_*** variables are required by the parser. Each of the lines where it appears
#    (e.g. anat:) defines the beginning of a Python dictionary, and the indented elements
#    after it are the dictionaries members.  The name of the dictionary and its "id" must 
#    be unique. For example, epis could have names of epi1, epi2 ... and id's of &id001, &id002, ...
#
# File type codes: brik=BRIK, nii=one-file nifti, ni1 = two_file nifti
